### **Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing crime data in Los Angeles from 2020 to the 
present. It explores crime trends, patterns, and hotspots using data mining techniques 
such as classification, clustering, and time series analysis. The goal is to provide 
meaningful insights for better understanding urban crime behavior. 

### **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
The dataset was collected from the Los Angeles Open Data Portal (Data.gov) and 
also supports local file uploads. The data was cleaned by handling missing values, 
removing duplicates, and engineering features like victim age, area, and weapon used. 
Categorical variables were encoded to prepare the data for modeling. 

### **Visualization and Modeling:** 

● EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) was done using plots and summaries to 
understand key crime statistics. Time Series Analysis was performed to study 
crime trends over time. 

● MODELS: Classification was implemented using a Decision Tree Classifier to 
predict crime categories. Clustering was performed using K-Means(cluster based 
on weapons) and AGNES Hierarchical Clustering to group similar crime 
incidents and analyze crime hotspots.

### **Tools and Technologies:**

● Python,Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn 

● Streamlit for building an interactive web application 

### **OUTPUTS:**
This project analyzes LA crime data and visualizes patterns.
